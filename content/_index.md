# Welcome

Welcome to Parkgrove Counselling. There are many reasons why you may be considering counselling. Are you feeling unhappy, hurt, confused or lacking in self-confidence? Perhaps you feel that you are going around in circles trying to find answers to a personal dilemma? Are you struggling to understand your feelings and emotions, or having difficulties relating to those around you? Is there something troubling you from your past or in your present? It can be daunting to take the first step into counselling but you’re almost there.

# What I offer

As a person-centred therapist, I offer a safe and confidential space where you can talk about the issues that are affecting you. With empathy and without judgement, I will help you explore your ways of thinking and being, and support you to find ways to live your life in a way that feels right for you. Rather than giving you answers or advice, I will help you shine a light on repeating patterns of behaviour or thinking that may be holding you back, helping you to find your own direction and a greater sense of inner peace. Normally we would meet on a weekly or fortnightly basis. The normal duration of a session is 50 minutes.
