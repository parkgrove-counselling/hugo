My practice is based in the Kelvingrove area of Glasgow and can be easily reached by public transport or car. There is usually metered parking available outside the building.

Please note that during the COVID-19 outbreak I am not able to offer face-to-face sessions but am continuing to offer online video sessions via Zoom.

I can be contacted by email or telephone. If I am not available, please leave a short message and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

If you are distressed and need urgent support, please call Samaritans on 116 123 or NHS 111.
