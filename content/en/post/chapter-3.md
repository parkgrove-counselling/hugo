Face-to-face session - from £45 (50 mins). Online video session - from £40 (50 mins).

Concession rates are available.

For face-to-face sessions, payments are usually paid in cash and taken at the end of each session. Payments can also be made via bank transfer prior to sessions. Receipts are available upon request. For video sessions payments should be made in advance by bank transfer.

I am happy to offer an initial 30 minute free session to establish if we feel we can work well together.

I take confidentiality and privacy very seriously. I collect, store and process personal data in line with GDPR and am registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office.
