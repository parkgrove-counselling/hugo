title: "What I offer"
---

As a person-centred therapist, I offer a safe and confidential space where you can talk about the issues that are affecting you. With empathy and without judgement, I will help you explore your ways of thinking and being, and support you to find ways to live your life in a way that feels right for you. Rather than giving you answers or advice, I will help you shine a light on repeating patterns of behaviour or thinking that may be holding you back, helping you to find your own direction and a greater sense of inner peace. Normally we would meet on a weekly or fortnightly basis. The normal duration of a session is 50 minutes.
